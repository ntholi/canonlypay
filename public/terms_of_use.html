    that you read all of these sections carefully and not just what we say below. Limitations of risk, legal responsibilities and liability. Sections 2A, 2B, 2C, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 17 and 19 are important because they limit and exclude obligations, liabilities
    and legal responsibilities that we and other persons or entities may otherwise have to you. As a result of these clauses, your rights and remedies against us and these other persons and entities are limited and excluded. These sections also limit
    and exclude your right to recover or make claims for losses, damages, liability or harm that you or others may suffer. Assumptions of risk, legal responsibilities and liability by you. Sections 2C, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17 and 19, are important
    because you take on risk, legal responsibilities and liability. As a result of these Sections, you may also be responsible for claims and other amounts. You will also be responsible for, and you accept, various risks, damages, harm, and injury which
    may be suffered by you and others for what is stated in these Sections. We will also be able to terminate our services to you as a result of these Sections. Acknowledgements of fact by you. Sections 2C and 15 are important because they each contain
    statements which are acknowledgements of fact by you. You will not be able to deny later that the statements are true. We may take action against you and may have claims against you as a result of these statements. Indemnities by you. Section 9 requires
    you to indemnify and hold harmless CanOnlyPay and other persons or entities against claims, loss, damages, and harm that that may be suffered by CanOnlyPay and other persons or entities as a result of the events set out in Section 10. You are also
    required to indemnify and hold harmless CanOnlyPay and other persons and entities against claims for loss, damages, and harm that that may be made by any person or entity as a result of the events set out in Section 9. This places various risks, liabilities,
    obligations and legal responsibilities on you. You will be responsible and liable for the payment of the value of the claims, loss, damages, and harm that that may be suffered or claimed by CanOnlyPay. 1. Acceptance CanOnlyPay is a private company

    such conduct. If none of the foregoing sections 17 (a) – (f) are applicable, you agree to pay CanOnlyPay’s actual damages, to the extent such actual damages can be reasonably calculated. Notwithstanding any other provision of these Terms, CanOnlyPay

    or delayed performance by you; and you agree, having taken account of the prejudice that will be suffered by CanOnlyPay, that the penalty stipulation is equitable in the circumstances. Please report any violations of the Terms that you become aware

    that the law does not allow them to be excluded. 19. Privacy Policy This CanOnlyPay Privacy Policy applies to how we collect, use and process your Personal Information when you use the CanOnlyPay website, the CanOnlyPay mobi site, or the services
    provided by CanOnlyPay. Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. This Privacy Policy forms part of the CanOnlyPay Terms of Use accessible. By accessing or using the CanOnlyPay website, the CanOnlyPay mobi site, or the services provided by CanOnlyPay
    you are agreeing to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use. If you do not comply with the Privacy Policy, that will also be a breach of the Terms of Use. CanOnlyPay and others will have claims and other rights against you under the Privacy Policy
    and the Terms of Use. To the extent that the Consumer Protection Act, No 68 of 2008 applies, we have a duty to point out certain important provisions in this Privacy Policy to you. The sections of this Privacy Policy which contain these important
    provisions and reasons why they are important are set out below. It is also very important that you read all of these sections carefully and not just what we say below. Limitation of risk, legal responsibilities and liability. Sections A, C, D, F
    and G are important because they limit and exclude obligations, liabilities and legal responsibilities that we may otherwise have to you. As a result of these Sections, your rights and remedies against us and these other persons and entities are limited
    and excluded. These Sections also limit and exclude your right to recover or make claims for losses, damages, liability or harm you or others may suffer. These Sections also state that you know and accept that the Internet is not absolutely secure
    and there is a risk that your Personal Information will not be secure when transmitting over the Internet. Assumption of risk, legal responsibilities and liability by you. Sections A, B, E and G are important because you take on risk, legal responsibilities
    and liability. As a result of these Sections, you may also be responsible for claims and other amounts. You will also be responsible for, and you accept, various risks, damages, harm, and injury which may be suffered by you and others for what is
    stated in these Sections. In these Sections, you also waive your rights, and as a result, we may not have to perform our duties and you may not become aware of information that you may need to protect yourself. We respect your privacy and have developed
    a detailed Privacy Policy. This Privacy Policy describes our practices with respect to personal information collected via our website accessible at www.canonlypay.co.za, or our mobile site accessible at m.canonlypay.co.za , and associated services
    and tools, where users may engage in activities such as creating a profile, posting or viewing online schoolifieds listings, entering into transactions with other users, exchanging messages and performing a host of associated functions (the "Service").
    Our website and our mobile site are individually and collectively referred to as the "Website" in this Privacy Policy. In all cases we shall comply with applicable provisions of data protection law in the jurisdictions where we operate. This Privacy
    Policy is subject to the laws of the Republic of South Africa. This Privacy Policy forms part of our Terms of Use ("Terms of Use" or the "Terms"). By accessing the Website or using the Service, you agree that you have read, understood and agree to
    be bound by this Privacy Policy and you provide us with your express consent and agreement that we may collect, get, receive, record, organise, collate, store, update, change, retrieve, read, process, use and share your Personal Information in the
    ways set out in this Privacy Policy. When we do one or more of these actions with your Personal Information, we are "Processing" your Personal Information. The term "Personal Information" refers to your private information, such as your name and surname,
    age, date of birth, contact details (e.g. your home address, postal address, e-mail address or phone number), physical location, social media account details, profile pictures, and other information defined as "personal information" in laws. You are
    not allowed to make any use of the Website or the Service if you do not agree to this Privacy Policy. If you make any use of the Website or the Service, this will mean that you agree to this Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to this Privacy Policy,
    you must immediately stop using the Website and the Service. You should be aware that when you click certain links on our Website you could be directed to other companies’ properties outside of our hosted environment where the information collected

    by that third party provider. Listings and Transactions: We may host the information, including Personal Information and contact information, valid contact information and password necessary to provide our Services. Much of the same information used
    to create an account or profile may be required to post a listing. Any information users share in listings is their own responsibility. Like with profiles, users should carefully consider the risks of making certain personal information, particularly

    may automatically receive and log information on our servers from your browser or device including your IP address, software and hardware attributes, pages that you request, mobile identifiers, information about app usage, and other device or systems-level

    you and other users that we lawfully obtain from business partners or third parties. B. IP ADDRESS, COOKIES & MOBILE IDENTIFIERS: We may collect certain information through technology like cookies, pixels and local storage (like on your browser or
    device). Cookies are small text files that store information on your computer, mobile phone or other device locally. Pixels are small images that are part of codes on webpages that do things like allow another server to measure viewing of a webpage
    and often are used in connection with cookies. The code tracks if and when (and on which page) a pixel is loaded to indicate that a user has engaged with a specific screen or portion of a screen. With the help of cookies, the web server can save,
    for instance, preferences and settings on the user’s computer, mobile phone or other device which are then automatically restored on the next visit. Or to put it another way, the cookies are used, among other things, to make the use of the Website
    more user- friendly so that, for instance, you do not have to repeat the log-in process when you visit again. We use both persistent cookies and session cookies. Whereas persistent cookies remain on your computer for a longer period of time, session
    cookies are automatically deleted when the browser window is closed. We may allow third parties such as advertising or analytics providers to collect information using these types of technologies directly on our Website or from our mobile application.
    The data that they collect is subject to the applicable privacy policy of those third parties. C. USE OF THIS INFORMATION To provide our Services we may use the information we collect and host for the following general purposes: (i) to provide customer
    services, including to create and manage user accounts, to resolve technical difficulties and to enable features; (ii) to customize offers and experiences, including advertising on our properties or third parties’ properties; (iii) to monitor general
    and individual user activity, such as keyword searches, postings and transactional activity, and to manage traffic on the Website; (iv) to contact our users, including for service matters, customer care or permitted marketing communications via any

    on our network only for as long as is required to fulfil the above business objectives. D. INFORMATION SHARING We may share information we collect with our affiliates (an affiliate is (i) any company which controls CanOnlyPay from time to time; or
    (ii) any company which is controlled or owned by CanOnlyPay from time to time, or (iii) any company commonly controlled or owned with CanOnlyPay from time to time; or (iv) any entity forming part of CanOnlyPay's group of companies jointly offering
    the Service from time to time). These affiliates may be located in another country. These affiliates may only process and use this information to assist us for purposes described in this Privacy Policy and are bound to honour this Privacy Policy.
    We do not share Personal Information about our users with non-affiliated third parties unless we have our users’ specific permission to do so, or in the following circumstances: We may use third-party service providers to assist in offering aspects
    of our Services, in which case they shall have no authority to independently use any Personal Information they process on our behalf, and shall be subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy. We reserve the right to share information with private
    or public authorities that will enable us to fight fraud and abuse on our network, to investigate suspected violations of law, or to fight any other suspected breach of our terms of service. We may share Personal Information with government authorities
    as required by applicable law. As a matter of policy we do not rent or sell Personal Information about our users with non-affiliated third parties unless we have our users’ specific permission to do so. In the event that our business or a division
    of our business is reorganised or sold and we transfer all or substantially all of our assets to a new owner, your Personal Information may be transferred to the buyer to enable continuity of service. We may share certain non-personal information
    (data that does not identify our users individually) with third-party service providers, trusted partners or approved researchers in order to better understand what advertisements or services may interest you, to improve the overall quality and effectiveness
    of our Services or their services, or to contribute to academic research that we believe is of broader social benefit. E. USER CONTROLS Access, Correction and Deletion: Users can access, correct or delete their Personal Information by writing to us
    at the following address: support@canonlypay.co.za or legal@canonlypay.co.za. You are responsible for keeping the data you provide or post on our network accurate. If your account was created through an identity provider (e.g. Facebook Connect) you
    may also disable or change the account information through the settings offered by the identity provider (e.g. on Facebook.com). Third Party Choice: Certain third parties active on our site, e.g. Google Adwords, give you the ability to opt out of
    their collection and use of information for interest-based advertising. You can visit http://www.youronlinechoices.com. or http://www.networkadvertising.org to learn more about this practice and to exercise choices over how this type of information
    may be collected and used. Cookies: Most major desktop and mobile web browsers (eg Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, Chrome, Opera) provide controls that allow you to limit or block the setting of cookies on your systems. Note that disabling cookies
    in your browser for either first-party domains (the sites you actively visit) or third-party domains (companies other than those you directly visit on the Web) may result in decreased functionality in certain instances. F. SECURITY All information
    we collect is protected by reasonable technical means and reasonable security procedures in order to prevent unauthorised access or use of data. Our affiliates, trusted partners and third-party service providers have committed to manage the information
    in accordance with our requirements for security and privacy. Unfortunately, the transmission of information via the internet is not completely secure. Although we try protect your Personal Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your information
    in the course of its transmission. G. CHANGES TO THIS POLICY This Privacy Policy was last updated on 15 March 2017. We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. All changes to this Privacy Policy will take effect from the time that CanOnlyPay
    places them on the Website. You are responsible for reviewing and checking this Privacy Policy whenever you wish to use the Website, Service or the Content. H. SEVERABILITY Each provision of this Privacy Policy, and each part of any such provisions,
    is separate and severable from the others. To the extent that any provision in this Privacy Policy, or any part of such provision is, becomes or is declared by a court of competent jurisdiction or other competent authority to be unlawful, invalid
    or unenforceable for any reason or in any jurisdiction, then it will, to the extent that it is unlawful, invalid or unenforceable, be severed from this Privacy Policy and treated as if it had not been written (ie pro non scripto), without invalidating
    or affecting the enforceability of the remainder of such provision or the remainder of this Privacy Policy. I. CONSUMER PROTECTION ACT AND ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS AND TRANSACTIONS ACT If this Privacy Policy is regulated by the Consumer Protection
    Act, 68 of 2008 ("CPA") or the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, 25 of 2002 ("ECTA") or Protection of Personal Information Act, 4 of 2013 ("POPI"), it is not intended that any provision of this Privacy Policy contravenes any provision
    of the CPA or ECTA or POPI. Therefore all provisions of this Privacy Policy must be treated as being qualified, to the extent necessary, to ensure that the provisions of the CPA, ECTA and POPI are complied with. Nothing in this Privacy Policy: limits
    or exempts CanOnlyPay or any person from any responsibility or liability (including, without limitation, for any loss directly or indirectly attributable to the gross negligence or wilful default of OLX or any other person, or that of any person acting
    for or controlled by CanOnlyPay or any other person) to the extent that the law does not allow this; or requires you to assume risk or responsibility or liability (including, without limitation, for the kind of loss referred to above) to the extent
    the law does not allow this; or excludes any warranties implied into this Privacy Policy by law, to the extent that the law does not allow them to be excluded. J. CONTACT INFORMATION Questions about this policy can be directed to legal@canonlypay.co.za
